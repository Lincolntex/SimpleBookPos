 * DataBaseManager defines all the structure of all data models
 * that will be stored in our database, as well as functoins for
 * creating those models in our code. It also defines functions
 * for inserting, updating, retrieving, and deleting objects in 
 * our database, think of this as the middleman between our application
 * and our databse. the database should not be accessed from anywhere 
 * outside of the functions defined in this file.
